                                Residential College (ResCo) is a coeducational residence hall community home to about 470 first-year students. 
                                ResCo, completed in 1989, offers a wide range of experiences to its students, staff, and four full-time, 
                                live-in faculty members. These faculty members, in conjunction with residence life staff, are integral in 
                                offering students a full academic experience. While living in ResCo, a student has the opportunity to interact 
                                with faculty outside of the classroom in an informal, relaxed atmosphere. Faculty eat in the dining room with 
                                students, participate in intramural events with students, and host dinners and other varied educational events 
                                for students.

                                University Terrace, located on the corner of 52nd street and Westfield Boulevard, just across the street from 
                                the Davey Athletic Complex (baseball filed).  It is one of the apartment buildings owned by the University. 
                                It houses nearly 100 students. UT usually houses a mix of sophomore, junior, and senior students. UT may also 
                                house graduate students, although that is rare.

                                UT apartments have variable layouts.  The most common are two bedroom, two bathroom apartments for four people. 
                                Two roommate share each bedroom. One bathroom is inside a bedroom, the other bathroom is off the hallway to 
                                the bedrooms. The other common apartment type is a one bedroom, one bathroom apartment for two people. Each 
                                resident gets a bed, mattress (XL twin), dresser, desk and desk chair. The largest part of the apartment is 
                                the living room, which has plenty of space for two 6 foot couches/futons and a TV stand. Many times students 
                                choose to put desks in this area to create a study space. The kitchen has a dishwasher, a stove, and a full 
                                refrigerator. Although there is no microwave provided, residents are allowed to have one. The kitchen is 
                                smaller, but there is good storage space. There is a coat closet near the entrance. ​Students will need to 
                                provide their own light sources for the living room and bedrooms.

                                Students assigned to apartments are not be required to participate in the University’s meal plan because they 
                                have full kitchens in their apartments. However, they may choose to purchase a meal plan to supplement their 
                                own cooking.
